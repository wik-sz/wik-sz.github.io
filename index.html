        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Chill the dough: The dough is sticky once it’s all beaten together in your mixing bowl and therefore, it absolutely MUST be chilled for at least 3 hours. Give yourself enough time in the kitchen or make the cookie dough and chill it overnight. You want your cookie dough firm so the cookies hold their shape and you want your cookie dough manageable so you can work with it. You won’t have either unless you have chilled cookie dough!</p>
        
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Wrap up the dough: It’s easiest to wrap the dough in plastic wrap before chilling. Scoop out 1/2 of the prepared cookie dough, plop it onto a long sheet of plastic wrap, wrap it up, and flatten it out into a disc. Repeat with the other 1/2 of dough. Then chill. See that photo above? That’s what you’re doing, but you’ll have 2 discs. Why are you doing this? It’s easier to roll out the chilled cookie dough when it is in a disc shape. Also, the cookie dough chills faster when there is less volume. And it’s just easier to work with smaller portions when rolling/shaping!</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Roll it out: After chilling, roll out the chilled cookie dough discs until about 1/4-inch thick. Don’t be afraid to flour your hands, rolling pin, work surface, and everything in the world. By that, I mean: the cookie dough can become sticky as you work. So, don’t be scared to add more flour to the work surface. The flour spots on top of your shaped cookie dough will bake off.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1.</strong>Brine turkey for 24 hours: Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a large pot. Stir in sugar and salt until dissolved. Add vinegar, bay leaves, and peppercorns and remove from heat. Add ice to cool the mixture. Stir in mustard until dissolved.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2.</strong>Remove turkey from brine and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels. Discard brine.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3.</strong>Preheat oven to 375°F with the rack in the lowest position. Place turkey in a roasting pan fitted with a rack. Loosen the skin and rub butter underneath and on the outside of the skin, dividing evenly. Season with salt and pepper. Roast for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4.</strong>Reduce oven to 325°F and roast 1 1/2 hours. (Tent breasts with oiled aluminum foil if they become too dark.)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5.</strong>Make glaze: Preheat oven to 350°F. Place chiles on a rimmed baking sheet. Roast until slightly dried and toasted, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with water; cover bowl with plastic wrap. Soak until soft, turning once, 30 to 35 minutes. Reserve 3/4 cup soaking liquid; drain chiles. Blend chiles and reserved liquid, in batches, until smooth, 1 to 2 minutes. Strain into a large saucepan, pressing to release as much liquid as possible. Add cocoa powder, oregano, onion, bay leaf, garlic, lemon juice, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, 20 minutes. Cool completely. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve; discard solids. Meanwhile, cook orange juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat until thick and syrupy, 20 to 30 minutes. Whisk in reserved red chile sauce, 1 tablespoon at a time, until smooth and thick. Remove from heat.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6.</strong>Continue roasting, glazing twice with Red Chile and Orange Glaze, until an instant-read thermometer inserted in thickest part of thigh registers 165°F, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7.</strong>Gently tilt turkey to release juices from cavity into the pan. Transfer turkey to a cutting board; rest at least 30 minutes before carving.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8.</strong>Scrape browned bits from bottom of the pan and transfer, along with pan juices, to a large straight-sided skillet; reserve.</p>
